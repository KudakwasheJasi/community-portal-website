# TODO: Event Registration Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Backend event registration functionality (registerForEvent, unregisterFromEvent)
- [x] Backend CRUD operations for events (create, read, update, delete)
- [x] Backend user registration tracking
- [x] Client-side API service for events
- [x] EventContext with state management and optimistic updates
- [x] EventCard component for displaying individual events

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Create EventForm component for creating new events
- [ ] Test event registration functionality

- Frontend has EventContext with proper state management for user and event states
- Events page uses MainDashboardLayout for consistent design
- EventCard and EventList components are created and functional
- EventForm component needs to be implemented for event creation
